///////////////Technologies used/////////////////////
-Express API
-RESTful Routes
-AJAX
-jQuery
-Handlebars.js
-MongoDB
-Mongoose.js
-HTML/CSS
-Bootstrap


///////////////Things I learned/////////////////////
Definitely worth while to do bare minimum to achieve a working site, then progressively improve efficiency and functionality.

Update: Was glad to be able to meet a few of my stretch goals, but looking forward to revisiting to include additional stretch goals of email validation and improve the functionality of the comments section.

///////////////Where I went wrong///////////////////
Tried coding with an end result in mind instead of really understanding or pursuing MVP logic.
This resulted in broken, confusing, and a partially completed project which I restarted halfway through (also a bad call).

Update: Everything working with the exception of comments being seeded or updating on Heroku. Comments are able to submit on local host, so additional debugging is required.

 ///////////////Outcomes John Danger Ruhsam style////////////
A better course would have been to begin with creating a barebones functioning front end, barebones back end, connect with ajax, create http routes, update with CRUD functions, and begin refinement.
