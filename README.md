README...or don't your call


///////////////Things I learned/////////////////////
Definitely worth while to do bare minimum to achieve a working site, then progressively improve efficiency and functionality.

///////////////Where I went wrong///////////////////
Tried coding with an end result in mind instead of really understanding or pursuing MVP logic.
This resulted in broken, confusing, and a partially completed project which I restarted halfway through (also a bad call)

 ///////////////Outcomes John Danger Ruhsam style////////////
A better course would have been to begin with creating a barebones functioning front end, barebones back end, connect with ajax, create http routes, update with CRUD functions, and begin refinement.
